# CVPR_2018_Final_Project
This repository hosts the material for the final project of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition course, offered at University of Trieste in the academic year 2018/2019.
# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to implement an image classifier that is able to distinguish between different scenes. The approach adopted is the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. The dataset to carry out the experiments (from [Lazebnik et al., (2006)]) has been provided and consists of 15 scene categories (office, kitchen, living room, bedroom, store, industrial, tall building, inside city, street, highway, coast, open country, mountain, forest, suburb). As we can see, the scenes can be conceptually "clustered" in three groupings: outdoors (e.g. coast, open country, mountain, forest), indoors e.g. (office, kitchen, store) and hybrid scenes (e.g. suburb). This distinction will become more evident as we present the results.
# Approach and Implementation
The following tasks have been tackled and accomplished:
